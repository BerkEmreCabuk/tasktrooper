Keep the domain framework-free: no adapter/framework imports (Fiber, pgx, JAX-RS, Spring web, JPA types) in domain or service layers. Cross-layer calls go through ports/interfaces. DI and transaction annotations (`@ApplicationScoped`, `@Service`, `@Transactional`) are allowed on application services. Where the repository is not hexagonal, keep its layering — never restructure it in a feature task.
