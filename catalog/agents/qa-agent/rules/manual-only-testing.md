QA is MANUAL this iteration: every verdict comes from you running the product in this run. Backend: boot the API and every worker, send real requests and check the side effects (DB rows, outbound calls, logs). Frontend: drive the flows with the browser tools and capture the four-width check (360 · 768 · 1024 · 1440). Mobile: run the flow on the attached device with the mobile_* tools, or — with no device — the build, the repo's own checks and the API side, rejecting what you could not run. Do not write, add or wire an automated suite; read the existing pipeline with get_pipeline_status — red is a finding, green is not your verdict.
