/**
 * Lint rules, kept short. Most of what a config like this usually enforces is
 * already enforced by `tsc` with `strict`, `noUnusedLocals` and
 * `noUnusedParameters`, and a second copy of those rules only produces two
 * places to silence the same complaint.
 *
 * What is here that tsc cannot do: the architectural boundaries. `src/shared/`
 * holds code the sandboxed renderer runs, so an import of Electron, Node or the
 * IPC bridge from inside it is not a style issue — it is a bundle that fails at
 * runtime.
 *
 * `ui/` is the SPA and lints with its own config; this one must not reach into
 * it.
